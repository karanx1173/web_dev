Day 27: String Manipulation

Topic: Working with Strings

Theory Content:

    Strings represent text and can be manipulated with string methods:
        toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(), slice(), substring(), split()
    Template literals (`...${variable}...`) allow embedding variables in strings.

Notes:

    Template literals make strings with variables easier to read.
    Practice with different string methods for effective text manipulation.
