Day 32: Promises in JavaScript

Topic: Working with Promises

Theory Content:

    Promises simplify async code and handle success/failure outcomes.
        .then() handles success, .catch() handles errors.
    Use Promise.all to handle multiple promises at once.

Notes:

    Promises improve readability and make async operations more manageable.
    Combining promises allows handling multiple async tasks.
