Day 23: Loops in JavaScript

Topic: Iteration and Loops

Theory Content:

    Loops repeat code blocks based on conditions.
        for loop: runs a set number of times.
        while loop: runs while a condition is true.
        do...while loop: runs at least once, then checks the condition.
        for...of and for...in for iterating over arrays and objects.

Notes:

    Be cautious of infinite loops by ensuring loop conditions are met.
    for...of is great for iterating over arrays, for...in for object properties.
