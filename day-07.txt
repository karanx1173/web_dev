Day 7: Introduction to CSS

Topic: What is CSS?

Theory Content:

    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to control the presentation of HTML elements.
    CSS provides control over the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of web content.
    Different ways to link CSS to HTML include inline styles, internal (within <style> tags), and external stylesheets (using <link>).

Notes:

    CSS helps maintain a separation of content (HTML) and presentation (CSS).
    External stylesheets are the preferred method as they keep HTML and CSS separate and organized.
