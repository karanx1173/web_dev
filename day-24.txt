Day 24: Functions and Scope

Topic: Defining and Using Functions

Theory Content:

    Functions are reusable blocks of code.
        Declared with function keyword or arrow syntax.
    Scope determines variable visibility.
        Local scope (within functions) vs. global scope (accessible throughout the script).

Notes:

    Functions help organize code and make it modular.
    Use arrow functions for shorter syntax in modern JavaScript.
