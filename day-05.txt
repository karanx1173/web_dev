### *Day 5: Best Practices and Validation*

On the last day of this weekâ€™s HTML training, I focused on best practices and ensuring that my HTML was correct. I learned about proper indentation and comments to make my code easier to read. I also explored the importance of validating HTML using the W3C Validator tool to check for errors. I went back to my previous pages and fixed any issues, ensuring they were both functional and semantically correct.

Key Takeaways:
- Best practices: Indentation, comments
- Validation: W3C Validator
