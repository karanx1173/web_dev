Day 26: Arrays in JavaScript

Topic: Understanding Arrays

Theory Content:

    Arrays store ordered lists of items.
    Common array methods:
        push(), pop(), shift(), unshift()
        map(), filter(), reduce()

Notes:

    Arrays are zero-indexed (first element is at index 0).
    map, filter, and reduce are powerful for data manipulation.
