Day 33: Async/Await

Topic: Using Async/Await for Cleaner Asynchronous Code

Theory Content:

    async/await is syntactic sugar for handling promises more naturally.
    await pauses code execution until a promise resolves or rejects.

Notes:

    Async/await simplifies reading and writing async code.
    Always use try...catch with async functions for error handling.
