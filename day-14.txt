Day 14: CSS Grid Basics

Topic: CSS Grid for Layouts

Theory Content:

    CSS Grid is a layout system that arranges elements in rows and columns.
    Important properties:
        display: grid; to start a grid container.
        grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows to define columns and rows.
        grid-gap or gap to set spacing between grid items.

Notes:

    CSS Grid provides greater control over complex layouts than Flexbox.
    Useful for designing multi-row or multi-column layouts.
