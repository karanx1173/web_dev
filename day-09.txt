Day 9: CSS Box Model

Topic: Understanding the Box Model

Theory Content:

    The box model consists of four parts: content, padding, border, and margin.
    Content: The area where text and images appear.
    Padding: Space inside the element, around the content.
    Border: A line that wraps around the padding and content.
    Margin: Space outside the element that separates it from other elements.

Notes:

    The box model is crucial for layout and spacing.
    Use box-sizing: border-box; to include padding and border within the element's total width and height.
