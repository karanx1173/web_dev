Day 22: Control Structures: Conditionals

Topic: Using Conditionals in JavaScript

Theory Content:

    Conditional statements control program flow based on conditions.
        if, else if, and else statements execute based on conditions.
        switch statements handle multiple conditions.

Notes:

    Always use === for comparison in conditional statements to avoid unexpected type coercion.
    Switch statements are useful for managing multiple possible values.
