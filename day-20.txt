Day 20: JavaScript Basics: Syntax and Variables

Topic: Syntax and Variables

Theory Content:

    JavaScript syntax consists of statements, comments, and code blocks.
    Variables store data and are declared using var, let, or const.
        let and const are preferred over var for modern JavaScript.
    Data types include strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

Notes:

    Use let for variables that can change and const for constants.
    JavaScript is loosely typed, so variables can change type.
