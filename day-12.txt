Day 12: CSS Positioning

Topic: Positioning Elements in CSS

Theory Content:

    CSS positioning properties:
        Static: The default position, which places elements according to the normal document flow.
        Relative: Positioned relative to its normal position.
        Absolute: Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
        Fixed: Positioned relative to the viewport and stays in place during scrolling.
        Sticky: A hybrid of relative and fixed positioning.

Notes:

    Fixed positioning is useful for elements like navigation bars that should remain visible.
    Absolute positioning removes elements from the normal document flow.
