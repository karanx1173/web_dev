Day 8: CSS Selectors and Specificity

Topic: Understanding CSS Selectors and Specificity

Theory Content:

    Selectors target HTML elements to apply styles.
        Element selector (e.g., p) applies styles to all elements of a specific type.
        Class selector (e.g., .example) allows multiple elements to share styles.
        ID selector (e.g., #header) applies styles to a unique element.
    Specificity determines which styles are applied when multiple selectors target the same element.
        ID selectors have higher specificity than class selectors, which have higher specificity than element selectors.

Notes:

    Specificity is essential for managing which styles are applied.
    Inline styles have the highest specificity and override other styles.
