Day 10: Colors and Backgrounds

Topic: Applying Colors and Backgrounds

Theory Content:

    CSS provides different ways to define colors: named colors, HEX, RGB, and HSL.
    Background properties:
        background-color to set the background color.
        background-image to set an image as the background.
        background-repeat and background-position to control image behavior.

Notes:

    RGBA and HSLA allow control over opacity.
    Use background-attachment: fixed; to keep a background image in place while scrolling.
