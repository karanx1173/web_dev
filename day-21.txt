Day 21: Operators and Expressions

Topic: Operators in JavaScript

Theory Content:

    Operators are used to perform operations on values.
    Types of operators:
        Arithmetic (+, -, *, /)
        Assignment (=, +=, -=)
        Comparison (==, ===, !=, !==)
        Logical (&&, ||, !)

Notes:

    === checks both value and type, whereas == only checks value.
    Logical operators are essential for condition handling.
