Day 15: CSS Transitions and Animations

Topic: Adding Transitions and Animations

Theory Content:

    Transitions smooth out changes in CSS properties over a specified duration.
        transition-property, transition-duration, and transition-timing-function are key properties.
    Animations allow control over multiple CSS property changes.
        @keyframes defines animation stages.
        animation-name, animation-duration, and animation-iteration-count are essential for animations.

Notes:

    Transitions work well for hover effects and smooth state changes.
    Use animations sparingly to maintain good performance.
