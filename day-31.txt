Day 31: Asynchronous JavaScript and Callbacks

Topic: Introduction to Asynchronous Programming

Theory Content:

    JavaScript is synchronous, but async operations (e.g., network requests) are needed.
    Callbacks: functions passed as arguments to run after an async operation completes.

Notes:

    Callbacks can lead to "callback hell" if nested too deeply.
    Understanding async operations is crucial for working with APIs and user interactions.
